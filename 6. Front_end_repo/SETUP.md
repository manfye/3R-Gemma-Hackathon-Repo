# Setup Guide - Hand Tracker Photo App

## Quick Start

The app is currently running with MediaPipe loaded via CDN. To enable full functionality, follow these steps:

### 1. Fix PowerShell Execution Policy (if needed)

If you get a PowerShell execution policy error, run this in PowerShell as Administrator:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install openai
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your OpenAI API key:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

**Important**: Use `OPENAI_API_KEY` (not `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY`) to keep your API key secure on the server side.

Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

### 4. Run the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Current Features

âœ… **Working Now:**
- Camera access and video display
- MediaPipe hand detection (loaded via CDN)
- 3-2-1 countdown timer when hand is detected
- Photo capture functionality
- OpenAI API integration for real classification
- Beautiful UI with Tailwind CSS
- Error handling and user feedback
- Real-time hand landmark visualization

ðŸš€ **Full Functionality:**
- Real-time hand detection using MediaPipe
- Automatic countdown when hand is detected
- Real AI classification using OpenAI GPT-4 Vision
- Hand landmark visualization
- Proper error handling for API calls

## How to Use

1. **Allow Camera Access**: When prompted, allow the app to access your camera
2. **Show Your Hand**: Position your hand in front of the camera
3. **Wait for Countdown**: The app will start a 3-2-1 countdown when hand is detected
4. **Photo Capture**: After countdown, a photo will be automatically captured
5. **View Results**: The AI will classify the garbage and show results
6. **Retake**: Click "Take Another Photo" to try again

## Garbage Categories

The app classifies items into 6 categories:
- **A: Cardboard** - Paper-based packaging
- **B: Glass** - Glass containers and bottles
- **C: Metal** - Metal cans and containers
- **D: Paper** - Paper items and documents
- **E: Plastic** - Plastic containers and packaging
- **F: Trash** - Non-recyclable items

## API Response Format

The app expects OpenAI to return JSON in this format:

```json
{
  "material": [
    {
      "part_name": "cup",
      "answer": "D: Paper"
    },
    {
      "part_name": "lid",
      "answer": "E: Plastic"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### PowerShell Issues
- Run PowerShell as Administrator
- Execute: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
- Try again

### Camera Not Working
- Ensure you're using HTTPS (required for camera access)
- Check browser permissions for camera access
- Try refreshing the page

### Hand Detection Issues
- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Keep your hand clearly visible in the camera
- Try different hand positions
- Check MediaPipe status indicator

### API Errors
- Verify your OpenAI API key is correct
- Check your OpenAI account has sufficient credits
- Ensure you're using a supported model

### MediaPipe Loading Issues
- Check internet connection (MediaPipe loads from CDN)
- Try refreshing the page
- Check browser console for errors

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```
