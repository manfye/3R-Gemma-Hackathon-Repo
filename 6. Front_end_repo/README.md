**Security Note**: The API key is kept secure on the server side and never exposed to the client.

Get your OpenAI API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

### 3. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## How to Use

1. **Allow Camera Access**: When prompted, allow the app to access your camera
2. **Show Your Hand**: Position your hand in front of the camera
3. **Wait for Countdown**: The app will start a 3-2-1 countdown when hand is detected
4. **Photo Capture**: After countdown, a photo will be automatically captured
5. **View Results**: The AI will classify the garbage and show results
6. **Retake**: Click "Take Another Photo" to try again

## Garbage Categories

The app classifies items into 6 categories:
- **A: Cardboard** - Paper-based packaging
- **B: Glass** - Glass containers and bottles
- **C: Metal** - Metal cans and containers
- **D: Paper** - Paper items and documents
- **E: Plastic** - Plastic containers and packaging
- **F: Trash** - Non-recyclable items

## API Response Format

The app expects OpenAI to return JSON in this format:

```json
{
  "material": [
    {
      "part_name": "cup",
      "answer": "D: Paper"
    },
    {
      "part_name": "lid",
      "answer": "E: Plastic"
    }
  ]
}
```
